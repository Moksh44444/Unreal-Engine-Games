Gameathon 7.0 Arena-Style Game
This game was developed as part of Gameathon 7.0, a gaming hackathon held at Jyothi Institute of Technology, Bangalore. The event challenged participants to create a fully working game within a 24-hour time frame, which included presentation, documentation, and a gameplay working demo.

About the Game
Our submission was an arena-style game, created by a team of two members, including myself. The game mechanics, features, and overall design are documented in the accompanying Game Design Document (GDD).

Development Highlights:
Focus: We prioritized building a functional and engaging gameplay experience over optimization and file size, given the time constraints.
Tools and Technology: The game was developed using [add details about tools like Unity/Unreal Engine, etc.].
Time Period: The entire development process, including the creation of a presentation and documentation, was completed in 24 hours.
Challenges
Due to the limited time frame, we focused heavily on the core mechanics and ensuring the game was playable. This resulted in a larger file size that could not be uploaded to GitHub. Currently, the game is only available locally on my PC.

Future Plans
I plan to:

Optimize the game to reduce its file size.
Upload the game along with its assets to GitHub at a later date.
For now, the repository includes:

Hackathon Certificate.
Game Design Document (GDD), which details the mechanics and features of the game.
Thank you for checking out this project! Stay tuned for updates.
